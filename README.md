# 2FastThumbz
A port of the web app 7fastfingers into a mobile app. Made using React Native, using only Expo Snack. Different naming for obvious reasons.

## Installation/Try it!
1. Install Expo/Expo Client from Google Play Store/Apple App Store
1. Go to this link https://snack.expo.io/@kevinjonathan911/typing-test-mobile
1. Choose "Open with Expo"
1. Add app to homescreen

## Features
basically same with 7fastfingers as it's only a port of it
reset feature is not yet available as it is not possible to do a page reload on Expo Snack

## Known Bugs
Android: sometimes the first letter of the word is not registered even if we input correctly
